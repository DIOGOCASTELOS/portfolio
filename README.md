# Portfolio
Diogo Castelos University portfolio.

All the projects in this portfolio have the programming language or program required to run next to them. The ones with .exe only work in Windows.

There is also a folder called "design portfolio". This is a work that I produced in Y11 (grade 10) to show my class what I had produced in the design class. Not all projects are there and there are some incomplete sections.

In the Arduino Tunnelbook, there are more LED's that were going off to the tempo of the music, however, the recording could not capture those since it was recorded in bright daylight. All the LED's that were meant to be there ar shown in the images of the plan - also in the website.
